# Entity-Resolution
Veridion Deeptech Engineer Internship Challenge

This project addresses the problem of **entity resolution** â€” detecting and grouping duplicate records that refer to the same real-world company, even if their data varies slightly. The dataset consists of ~35k companies from different sources, which leads to inconsistencies in names, contact details, and web presence.

The goal was to build a system that assigns a group to each record, ensuring that all entries referring to the same company are grouped together.
